## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into a `client` directory for the React frontend and a `server` directory for the Node.js backend.





Of course. A good README.md file is essential for any GitHub project. It's the first thing visitors see and should explain what your project does, who it's for, and how to use it.

Here is a complete, well-formatted README.md file for the chat application.

Instructions:
In the root folder of your project (chat-app/), create a new file named README.md.

Copy the entire content below and paste it into that file.

Important: Replace the placeholder https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git with the actual URL of your repository.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend Server:**
    Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` directory.

    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the development server (runs on http://localhost:3001)
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will be running on port `3001`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend Client:**
    Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the `client` directory.

    ```sh
    # Navigate to the client directory
    cd client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the React application (runs on http://localhost:3000)
    npm start
    ```
    Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üéÆ How to Use

1.  Open two browser tabs or windows and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  In the first tab, enter a **Username** and a **Room ID** (e.g., "dev-room").
3.  Click **"Join A Room"**.
4.  In the second tab, enter a different **Username** but the **same Room ID**.
5.  Click **"Join A Room"**.
