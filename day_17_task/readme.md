## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend Server:**
    Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` directory.

    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the development server (runs on http://localhost:3001)
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will be running on port `3001`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend Client:**
    Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the `client` directory.

    ```sh
    # Navigate to the client directory
    cd client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the React application (runs on http://localhost:3000)
    npm start
    ```
    Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🎮 How to Use

1.  Open two browser tabs or windows and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  In the first tab, enter a **Username** and a **Room ID** (e.g., "dev-room").
3.  Click **"Join A Room"**.
4.  In the second tab, enter a different **Username** but the **same Room ID**.
5.  Click **"Join A Room"**.
6.  You can now start sending messages between the two tabs in real-time!
